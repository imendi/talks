## Elvis (and how to properly rock in the Erlang World)

Inaka (part of Erlang Solutions) has an ever growing team of Erlangers that usually divides in small teams to work together in different projects. To really be able to do so smoothly, some degree of uniformity on the generated code was required. Over the course of the years and the projects, we've compiled an (also ever growing) list of Erlang Standards and Best Practices that we enforce. They are now public at [github](https://github.com/inaka/erlang_standards) for all to see and contribute.

But, just stating the rules and giving new devs access to them was just the first step. In the spirit of [Hound](http://houndci.com), we created [Elvis](http://elvis.inakalabs.com). Elvis is an Erlang style-checker written in Erlang that you can run in your console or integrate nicely in your github projects.

Erlang Solutions invites you to join our next webinar featuring Brujo Benavides (Inaka's CTO). He'll present an overview of Elvis, he will let you how it works and how it was built. And he will also open the discussion about Erlang Standards and code styles.

In this webinar, you'll learn:
* What Elvis is and how it can improve your development cycles
* How to write Erlang code that checks your Erlang code
* How to integrate with github APIs
* Some Erlang coding styles and standards (open for debate ;))
